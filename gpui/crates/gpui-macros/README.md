# xgpui-macros

Procedural macros for **xgpui** actions, elements, application contexts and tests.

## When to use this crate

`xgpui` brings in and re-exports the macros used by application code. A
direct dependency is normally only needed when working on framework or macro
integration. This crate contains compile-time support, not a UI runtime.

For application setup, use the matching framework packages:

```toml
[dependencies]
gpui = { package = "xgpui", version = "1.0.0" }
gpui_platform = { package = "xgpui-platform", version = "1.0.0" }
```

The registry package is `xgpui-macros`; its Rust library name is
`gpui_macros`. Keep framework packages on a compatible xgpui release.
